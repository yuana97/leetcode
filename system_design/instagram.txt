- In any system design question, our first step is the same.
- Step 1: Outline Requirements
- You want to identify the exact features and operational goals you have for your service.
- For example:
- Features:
    - upload/download/view photos
    - search photos, say based on titles
    - users can follow other users
    - generate a 'newsfeed' of popular photos from people the user follows
- Operational Requirements:
    - High availabiity (something you should always say)
    - High reliability (never lose uploaded photos/videos)
    - Low latency (say 200ms) for News Feed generation
    - We can compromise on Consistency in favor or availability and low latency.

- High level:
    - Client -> Read API (view pics)
             -> Write API
             -> Search API
